As of version 1.4.1, this feature will always install AWS CLI v1. The option to select AWS CLI v2 has been removed due to AWS CLI v2 being moved to the Arch User Repository (AUR).

## OS Support

This Feature should work on recent versions of Arch Linux distributions with the `pacman` package manager installed.

`bash` is required to execute the `install.sh` script.
